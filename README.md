# Mob Games

Hey, Thomas here! 

Today @Leafd & I are launching a 1 week experience: The Mob Games 

Make a mod that adds a new mob to minecraft, and we'll add it to our server & give you an invite to the Mob Games. You have 5 days to complete the challenge (see the mob I added in the screenshot attached) and then we'll have 2 days of the Mob Games where you'll compete alongside other Hack Clubbers in a world full of the mobs you helped create. 

August 1 - 5th: Make a new mob 
August 6th - 7th: Compete in the Mob Games

It's totally okay if you're a beginner, the site will give you some guidance to help you get started. This was my first time adding a mob to the game, and it has been a bunch of fun! @Leafd has experience running large Minecraft servers with a bunch of mods, so he is a great person to go to as you need help. 

I hope to see you on the server soon!
